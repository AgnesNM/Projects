# MQTT Origins

MQTT is an IoT protocol that enables the exchange of messages between devices. It uses a publish-subscribe model to achieve this.

MQTT works very similarly to the HTTP/HTTPS protocol (where a client sends in a request to a server and receives a response containing what they requested). MQTT is however extremely lightweight and has a low footprint.

MQTT was created by Andy Stanford-Clark (IBM) and Arlen Nipper (CTO at Cirrus Link) in 1999. It is now an OASIS standard, with v3.1.1 being an older ISO standard as well. Version 5 is the latest [MQTT specification](https://mqtt.org/mqtt-specification/)

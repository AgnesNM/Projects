# How to Set Up MQTT with Eclipse Paho Python

MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport) is one of the most popular IoT protocols because it is lightweight, scalable, has near real-time information delivery, and will work even in places with unreliable network connectivity. 

Since a lot of IoT devices are battery-powered or have metered connections, they might not always be connected. With MQTT, messages can still be received or published when these devices reestablish the connection.

No matter the MQTT use case, data needs to be exchanged between and among devices. The MQTT protocol makes this exchange almost seamless.

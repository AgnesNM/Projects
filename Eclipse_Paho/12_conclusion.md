# 12. In Conclusion

We have learned about the MQTT protocol and why it is popular. We have also looked at its implementations in sending and receiving data between and among IoT devices using the pub-sub model. And gone through some python mqtt examples to help you understand how to subscribe and unsubscribe to messages, as well as publish them. We hope that you are able to get started on working with Eclipse Pahoâ€™s Python implementation.

# Projects

This is a repo of projects that I want to work on. They will be coding projects and documentation projects too. Some will be more of documenting my learning journey with the goal of becoming a better software developer and tech  writer as well.

## Project 1 - Atlassian Forge

I got interested in learning Forge because I wanted to have developers around where I live hanging out to code. I needed a common goal that would help us move in the same direction. So I created a Gantt Chart to help us stay on track as we went through Forge documentation.

As we went along, we actually realized we could work towards participating in the October Atlassian Hackathon. 

In the meantime, my goal is to study some Atlassian Forge use cases and build something with Forge

I am following a Udemy course as a Python refresher.
